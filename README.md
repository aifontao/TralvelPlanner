#### Description:

TravelPlanner is a web application built with Python (Flask), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of my final project for CS50x.
It helps users organize, plan, and reflect on their past, current, and future travels.

Users can:

- Create an account and log in to their personal dashboard
- Add detailed trips including country, city, and trip type (holiday, work, etc.)
- Mark trip status: wishlist, planning, scheduled, ongoing, or completed
- Edit and delete trip
- Add travel buddies and their relationship (e.g., friend, family, coworker)
- Edit and delete trip buddies
- Rate completed trips and leave notes or comments
- Change user password

This project focuses on clean design, user-friendly functionality, and meaningful travel organization.

Future versions may include:

- Add places to visit, food to try, and experiences to look forward to
- Budgeting tools, expense tracking, and API integrations for richer trip planning.
- Upload photos
- View trips on a basic map (static or interactive)
