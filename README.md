# TralvelPlanner

TravelPlanner is a web application built with Python (Flask), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of my final project for CS50x.
It helps users organize, plan, and reflect on their past, current, and future travels.

Users can: 
- Create an account and log in to their personal dashboard
- Add detailed trips including country, city, and trip type (holiday, work, etc.)
- Add places to visit, food to try, and experiences to look forward to
- Mark trip status: wishlist, planning, scheduled, ongoing, or completed
- Add travel companions and their relationship (e.g., friend, family, coworker)
- Rate completed trips and leave notes or memories
- Upload photos for a more visual experience
- View trips on a basic map (static or interactive)

This project focuses on clean design, user-friendly functionality, and meaningful travel organization.

Future versions may include budgeting tools, expense tracking, and API integrations for richer trip planning.
